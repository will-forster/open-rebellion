# Interface Reverse-Engineering Ledger

This ledger connects the [surface ledger](surface-ledger.json) to the original
executable and game resources. It tracks questions that static analysis can
answer without duplicating the screenshot inventory. The machine-readable queue
is in [reverse-engineering-ledger.json](reverse-engineering-ledger.json).

## Current answer

Ghidra and the owned original files can recover substantially more of the
missing interface contract. They can establish exact rectangles, control and
resource IDs, button state selection, command routing, window constructors,
display predicates, animation action tables, embedded audio, tactical event
routing, multiplayer timers, and error paths.

They cannot by themselves prove final palette output, compositing, animation
cadence, live two-peer behavior, or browser equality. Those cells still require
lossless captures from the original executable followed by native and browser
comparison.

## Proven strategic foundation

| Evidence | Static result | Surfaces |
|---|---|---|
| `REBEXE.EXE` `FUN_00421c70` | Faction-specific galaxy apertures and all twelve window-reference rectangles | CMD-01, CMD-04 |
| `FUN_00427270` | Original control positions, sizes, command IDs, and paired bitmap resource IDs | CMD-10 |
| `FUN_006028c0`, `FUN_00602d30`, `FUN_006030c0`, `FUN_006030f0`, and `FUN_006035f0` | Normal and captured-press paint states, pointer capture, release cancellation, dispatch, and disabled flags | CMD-10 |
| `FUN_005fca00`, `FUN_005fd170`, and `FUN_005fc140` | Strict four-edge rejection, bottom-left palette-key hit mask, natural-size paint, and control-window clipping | CMD-10 |
| `FUN_00422ce0` and freshly recovered `FUN_00429020` | `WM_COMMAND`, double-click routing, exact rail hit testing, child-window focus, and rail removal | CMD-03, CMD-04 |
| `FUN_00427010`, `FUN_00425d00`, `FUN_00426d00`, `FUN_00426e70`, `FUN_00426ee0`, `FUN_00427270`, and `FUN_0042b330` | Active 903 versus Display Off 902, GID captions, exact faction control, compact and expanded legends, native marker families, Popular Support thresholds, and floating 180×240 display-window path | CMD-02 |
| `FUN_00427270` and `FUN_00422ce0` | Nine Message Index rail controls per faction, exact 27x22 rectangles, resting and illuminated resource pairs, command IDs `0x136..0x13e`, and dispatch to `FUN_0042a240` | CMD-08 |
| `FUN_0044f670`, `FUN_00442d70`, and `FUN_0044c410` | Code-built, modeless object windows using GOKRES rather than an invented sidebar | CMD-03, OBJ-02–OBJ-14 |
| `FUN_0042d650` and freshly recovered `FUN_0042adb0` | Faction advisor/briefing DLL selection and exact advisor apertures | PRE-05, CMD-07 |

P46A implements the centered 640x480 strategic canvas, the 640x481 source
crop, both faction galaxy apertures, and one shared map, hit-test, blockade,
and advisor transform. Native tests and packaged-browser viewport checks
corroborate this shell checkpoint. UIP-B01 now implements the faction-specific
twelve-slot rail geometry and first focus, close, minimize, restore, and
eviction lifecycle. Exact active and inactive rail thumbnails plus the full
multiwindow matrix remain open. See the
[P46A evidence](evidence/2026-09-11-strategic-shell-canvas.md).

P46B restores the six primary faction controls from the recovered constructor,
paint, hit-test, capture, and `WM_COMMAND` paths. It removes the replacement
text strip and renders the exact normal and captured-press bitmap pairs. PR #11
corrects `0x131` to Encyclopedia, `0x132` to GID, and the side-globe `0x133` to
Game Options for both factions. F1 and F7 match the native destinations. GID
opens and closes its original menu, while Game Options and Encyclopedia fail
closed until their original bitmap windows exist. Full A0 captures, the
disabled path, destination compositions, and speed controls remain open. See
the [P46B evidence](evidence/2026-09-11-strategic-command-controls.md) and
[routing correction](evidence/2026-09-14-cockpit-routing-correction.md).

The first UIP-B01 checkpoint also replaces the invented sidebar with recovered
235x360 sector and 226x304 detailed-system shells. Original planet pictures,
relationship title art, six tab resource families, single and double-click
routing, pointer occlusion, and rail transitions work in both faction shells.
P46D maps characters, fleet representatives, facilities, regiments, special
forces, mines, and refineries to their GOKRES miniatures. It also restores the
three-column item viewport, STRATEGY `10365` through `10369` scrollbar art,
selection, displayed labels, bounded input, and coarse current-intelligence
gating for opposing objects. Nested compositions, exact intelligence rules,
drag and command semantics, uncommon states, and the complete A0 matrix remain open. See the
[navigation evidence](evidence/2026-09-11-strategic-window-navigation.md) and
[tab-item evidence](evidence/2026-09-11-detailed-system-tab-items.md).

P49 restores the eighteen source-mapped Message Index rail resting BMPs. Both
faction rails match their original 8-bit resources pixel-for-pixel at 640x480.
The illuminated predicate and original Message Index destination remain open.
See the [rail evidence](evidence/2026-09-12-message-index-rail.md).

P60 recovers and implements the Game Speed control. The day readout opens a
five-item STRATEGY menu (`FUN_0042d190`), and the rates come from
`FUN_00487eb0`. Pause sets a stop day one day ahead (`FUN_0041d2f0`,
`FUN_0041e290`) and opens the REBDLOG alert (`FUN_00417020`), and
TEXTCOMM accelerator table 11 maps the speed keys. The same pass recovers the
Message Index window (`FUN_0042a240`, `FUN_00466350`), its category mapping,
the rail resting path, and the Advice Very Slow drop (`FUN_00487ff0`). The
rail illumination-on path is not yet recovered. See the
[game-speed recovery](evidence/2026-09-24-game-speed-recovery.md) and
[Message Index recovery](evidence/2026-09-24-message-index-recovery.md).

P47A identifies STRATEGY 900 and 901 as the faction shells, with 902 and 903 as
the bright and dim galaxy resources. P47B proves 902 belongs to Display Off and
903 to every active GID mode, then restores the default Popular Support caption,
exact faction GID control, compact 10168 legend, native 10146 through 10158
marker families, and support-size thresholds. It also establishes that the
nine tall side controls are Message Index categories, not GID filters. P48
maps the code-built GID command tree. P50 restores the STRATEGY 10100 through
10107 menu-frame tiles with instant display and source-pixel browser checks.
P51 withholds an unsupported hover wash and verifies frame pixels still visible
beneath the detailed system window.
The menu interior, typography, exact geometry, expanded 180x240 legend,
remaining modes and overlays, and exact map input remain open. See the
[galaxy-backdrop evidence](evidence/2026-09-11-authored-galaxy-backdrop.md) and
[Popular Support evidence](evidence/2026-09-11-popular-support-gid.md), plus the
[P50 frame record](evidence/2026-09-12-gid-menu-frame.md) and
[P51 overlap record](evidence/2026-09-12-gid-hover-and-occlusion.md).

The read-only Ghidra pass also recovered six formerly empty high-priority UI
exports and the `CoolStrobeButton` paint/input path. The text export is not a
complete interface corpus: of 4,934 canonical `FUN_????????.c` files, 2,790 are
zero-byte placeholders. New interface work must query the saved Ghidra project
when a required export is empty.

## Original resource truth

Runtime pack v2 contains 52 game-data entries, 2,303 standard BMPs, all 3,988
ALSPRITE and EMSPRITE type-302 frames, and 118 audio files: two music cues,
four menu effects, 22 tactical weapon effects, and 90 tactical command voices.
The owned
installation contains important additional families that are not yet staged or
packed:

| Original module | Additional authentic content currently omitted |
|---|---|
| ALSPRITE | 752 BIN controls and 213 WAVs; its 38 BMPs and 1,640 type-302 frames are staged |
| EMSPRITE | 753 BIN controls and 216 WAVs; its 34 BMPs and 2,348 type-302 frames are staged |
| ALBRIEF | 366 BIN controls, 2,684 type-302 frames, 17 WAVs |
| EMBRIEF | 471 BIN controls, 2,738 type-302 frames, 22 WAVs |
| TACTICAL | 87 type-301 DirectX meshes, 397 type-303 textures, and 44 WAVs beyond the 22 staged weapon variants |
| VOICEFXA and VOICEFXE | 195 WAVs beyond the 90 staged battle-ready and group-command recordings |
| STRATEGY | 96 RCDATA resources and 66 WAVs beyond its staged BMPs |
| REBDLOG and TEXTCOMM | Original dialog chrome, text, templates, and accelerators |
| EData and ENCYTEXT | 187 400×200 entity images and 348 descriptions |
| MDATA | 15 Smacker films and the remaining original music cues |

The droid path is now concrete. `C3POACT.SPT` and `IMP22ACT.SPT` map logical
actions to BIN resource IDs, which in turn reference standard bitmap anchors and
type-302 frame runs. The current sorted-filename thirds and modulo frame mapping
in `advisor.rs` are provisional and cannot pass parity.

## Work queue

The queue contains 27 bounded packages. Every one of the 43 required surface
families links to at least one package with named sources, a retrieval method,
and a next proof in the [machine-readable ledger](reverse-engineering-ledger.json).

### RE-ENC-01 semantic checkpoint

The [source contract](../../reference/asset-library/encyclopedia-source-contract.md#semantic-research-checkpoint)
records the profile-bounded decision table and the machine-readable ledger holds
the same testable scenario IDs. Static recovery now proves:

- selector order `0x6f`, `0x70`, `0x71`, `0x72`, `0x73`, `0x74`, `0x75`
  from `FUN_0045ddc0` and the exact `FUN_0045f100` early-return/forced
  transitions; `0x6f` binds shell `+0x474`, it does not clear a list;
- shell `+0x474` is an if-null, once-per-shell master cache built by
  `FUN_00422620` from registry definitions and a viewer-side system iterator;
  category changes filter that retained cache rather than reading a fresh
  campaign snapshot;
- both master and filtered collections use `FUN_0060a790(..., 2)` and
  `FUN_005f59f0`, so `FUN_0060a890`/`FUN_00626ad0` impose case-insensitive
  narrow-byte order with stable source-order ties;
- class and entity contexts route through definition `+0x30` low12 + `0x1000`,
  including the connected `FUN_0045fd90` entity fallback, rather than treating
  raw entity identity as topic identity;
- the viewer-side system iterator selects a type-`0x90` view and calls its
  vtable `+0x10` predicate, `FUN_004f6330`; that function walks the view's
  `+0x1c` container ancestry and causes `FUN_0053f090` to exclude the view
  exactly when an ancestor's virtual type is `0xf2`;
- row vtable functions `FUN_004ad730`/`FUN_004ad750` skip disabled neighbors,
  preserve non-wrapping endpoints, and operate over the sorted bound list; and
- the bounded viewer-side and system-picture EData key selectors in
  `FUN_0045fa60`.

The package remains `static-partial` and `runtime_capture_required`. The system
predicate is structurally recovered, but source type `0xf2` remains deliberately
unnamed: `FUN_005696b0` installs vtable `0x006639b8`, whose `+4` method
`FUN_00569880` returns `0xf2`; that proves the exact ancestry test, not a
friendlier knowledge, destruction, or visibility label. For the inspected
source profile, Luke key `0x1842` maps to `EDATA.074`, `0x2842` is empty, and
ENCYBMAP has no `EDATA.192` mapping; recovered REBEXE static evidence includes
the `EDATA\` directory-literal reference inside `FUN_0045f7b0` and the identified
table-selector loader callers, but does not establish a connected selector or
predicate. `EDATA.192` therefore remains inventory-only under the current
publication policy and no alternate-Luke predicate, runtime binding, or UI
switch is published. The user-approved scope defers that research to
`orlocal-2kq`; the asset remains inventoried but unused and does not block E08,
the first-profile schema, or publication. This is not proof that original
behavior is impossible or that the alternate was implemented. Static asset
presence does not imply gameplay visibility, and no expression or mod-supplied
predicate may substitute for future proof.

The repository ledger validator continues to validate the shared ledger shape,
surface coverage, and required package fields; it does not inspect the nested
`semantic_research` contract. E08's retained ignored semantic checker separately
validates all 14 rule records, all 25 named decision scenarios, their references
and required fields, the recovered selector transitions, cache/comparator
contract, canonical context key, exact type-`0xf2` system predicate, and bounded
alternate evidence state: inventoried, unused, deferred to `orlocal-2kq`, with
no predicate or runtime binding.

The [original UI contract](../../reference/asset-library/encyclopedia-ui-contract.md)
adds the E27 source checkpoint without changing those 14 semantic rules or 25
scenarios. `FUN_00429f30` constructs at most one shell child `0x19` through
`FUN_0045d400` with a 470 × 330 client. `FUN_0045ddc0` supplies the exact
faction chrome, category and mode controls, header/index/list/body rectangles,
navigation controls, and `STRATEGY.DLL` resource-state IDs. It selects the
faction shell/rail first, then creates both mode composites from that same
pair: topic background `1` uses shared overlay `0x2861` at `(12,14)`, while
index background `2` uses shared overlay `0x2862` at `(12,13)` and has static
text resource `0x1843` created at `(36,48)` with zero initial extent, measured
by `FUN_00601b80` through `DrawTextA` flag `0x400`, and rendered into it before
registration.

`FUN_0045f480` selects `2` for index and `1` for topic; `0x1843` is proven as
baked static text but is not assigned a guessed semantic label. The connected
`CoolStrobeButton` path proves normal, captured-press, disabled, and selected
bitmap slots; it exposes no separate hover-resource transition.

The missing checked-in function bodies were bounded directly against the same
identified `REBEXE.EXE`: `0x0041d6b0` obtains the active shell and forwards
typed context to `FUN_00429f30`, while `0x0045da70` dispatches close `0xfb`,
mode container `0x66`, category container `0x6e`, list `0x65`, and navigation
`0x83`/`0x84`. Context-free shell paths are F7 (`0x76`) and command `0x131`.
An exhaustive direct-call scan proves five contextual callers into
`FUN_0041d6b0`: unrenamed handlers `0x00438800` command `0x67`, `0x004443a0`
command `0x66`, and `0x00467f10` commands `0x67`/`0x97` with selected-child
type `4`; `FUN_0046c3c0` command `0x67`; and `FUN_00486fb0` event `0x100`.
Their selected-row, guarded retained-context, selected-child, mission-row, and
first-row flows are recorded by address. No visible surface name is inferred
from proximity.

Index focus belongs to the `CoolDragList`; Return emits the same `0x309`
activation as a double-click and enters topic mode. In index mode Left uses
`FUN_005f5c60` predecessor traversal and Right uses the threaded successor;
both skip hidden non-null candidates. An immediately null candidate falls back
to the tree's leftmost child through `FUN_005f5060`, so Left at the first child
reselects it and Right at the last child wraps to it. Running off an edge only
after hidden candidates retains the current category. The immediate fallback
does not visibility-test the first child. `FUN_0060d7e0` sends the category
command, whose branch at `0x0045dad0` explicitly focuses the list after
rebuilding/binding it. Topic focus belongs to the read-only `TextScrollField`;
Left/Right navigate topics without wrapping, Up/Down/Page keys scroll, and
Return is forwarded with no encyclopedia-local topic action. Body measurement
uses `DrawTextA` flags `0x2410`, source word/newline/tab handling, and a
conditional scrollbar. The apparent ship statistics in A3 guide capture 027
travel through the ordinary `ENCYTEXT.DLL` body-string path: no live-stat
control or world-field binding is present in the recovered constructor,
mode/render, and text-population paths.

The package deliberately remains `static-partial` and
`runtime_capture_required`. The finite `ENC-UI-01..21` matrix distinguishes the
static contract from missing A0 proof for both factions, all seven category
commands, index Left/Right traversal and edge behavior, button states,
click/Return behavior, typed context routes,
unavailable context, faction/system selectors, type-`0xf2` admission, first /
middle / last navigation, a legitimate no-art trigger, body wrap/scroll, and
close/focus routing. Hidden-category capture remains conditional on recovering
a connected original visibility configuration. Guide captures 018, 019, and
027 are A3 leads only. A0 contradictions must reopen source/schema review
before consumers change.

Space battle is an explicit full mode, not a single panel. `TAC-01` through
`TAC-07` currently define 106 baseline cells covering battle entry, both
faction HUDs, capital ships, fighters, assignment, selection, targeting,
damage, camera and navigation, maneuvers, tactics, missions, recovery,
withdrawal, simulation and observation, Death Star controls, trench-run
routing, results, and strategic return. `EVT-02` owns Battle Alert entry;
`TAC-08` remains the separate strategic ground-assault report flow.

P54 now supplies the raw-resource boundary for `RE-TAC-02`: 87 type-301
binary X meshes and 397 type-303 texture or palette resources reproduce from
the owned `TACTICAL.DLL` with exact identities and hashes. The
[P54 evidence](evidence/2026-09-12-tactical-3d-staging.md) records the inventory
and one embedded mesh-to-texture edge. P55 decodes all of them into a
deterministic runtime store and verifies the mesh corpus against Assimp 6.0.5;
see its [evidence](evidence/2026-09-12-tactical-3d-runtime-pack.md). P56
packages and visibly renders exact pair `2560/1033` plus
`SDESTI52.BMP/1033`. P57A adds resources `2561/1033` and `2562/1033`, the
second named texture, and the original high- and reduced-detail LOD predicate
traced through `FUN_005d26c0`, `FUN_005d3770`, and `FUN_005d3650`; see its
[evidence](evidence/2026-09-13-tactical-3d-lod-family.md). P57B1 adds
`FUN_005c1160`, whose slot 2, 1, 0, restore sequence corroborates cached object
switching, and proves the live sequence with one browser family load; see its
[evidence](evidence/2026-09-13-tactical-live-lod-journey.md). P57B2A traces
`FUN_005c1d30`, `FUN_005d9490`, `FUN_005d9620`,
`FUN_005d9640`, and the command switch at `0x005d97c0` to recover exact faction
pose, field zoom, clip, orbit, pitch, and target-command state. Its
[evidence](evidence/2026-09-13-tactical-camera-contract.md) proves the bounded
camera fixture and four bitmap D-pad directions. P57B2B1 recovers switch case
9 through `FUN_00595be0` and `FUN_005c1080`, activates resources 1058/1059,
and proves its selected-object record and fallback centering; see its
[evidence](evidence/2026-09-13-tactical-target-control.md). P57B2B2 recovers
`FUN_005ab650`'s active-object count, docked-fighter exclusion, battle extent,
and four tactical lanes; see its
[evidence](evidence/2026-09-13-tactical-battle-layout.md). P57B2B3 traces
`FUN_005a9030` and the placement callsites, binds stable DAT and
unfiltered fleet-roster identity to production participants, reproduces the
source X-slot sequence and four faction lanes, and sends the selected source
world point to the camera. Its
[evidence](evidence/2026-09-13-tactical-participant-placement.md) closes that
bounded recovery package. P57B2C1 proves that the original path preserves
authored mesh coordinates without center/scale normalization, packages every
system palette, and selects `5530 + SYSTEMSD.picture_id`; see its
[evidence](evidence/2026-09-13-tactical-transform-palette.md). The P57B2C2A
light checkpoint recovers `FUN_005d4d10`'s directional RGB `0.8`
frame at `(5,5,-1)`, origin target with Z constraint, and ambient RGB `0.5`;
see its [evidence](evidence/2026-09-14-tactical-light-rig.md). P57B2C2B then
recovers `FUN_005c1c10` and `FUN_005d6e10` device and material state; see its
[evidence](evidence/2026-09-14-tactical-render-state.md). The
[P58A evidence](evidence/2026-09-14-tactical-resource-join.md) then joins the
source-named tactical registry to every ship and fighter DAT identity, removes
approximate sprite arithmetic, and browser-proves complete 87-mesh and
397-texture transport. [P58B evidence](evidence/2026-09-14-tactical-production-participants.md)
proves live production capital-family drawing at recovered source positions.
[P58C evidence](evidence/2026-09-14-tactical-fighters-selection.md) proves the
type-303 fighter resource triplets, exact detail thresholds, production fighter
pixels, and projection-aligned capital interactions. The
[P58D evidence](evidence/2026-09-14-tactical-fighter-detail-journey.md) proves
the nine independent indicator/far/close transitions through the original zoom
controls without family reload. The
[P58E evidence](evidence/2026-09-14-tactical-group-presentation.md) restores all
eight task-force and four RGBY controls, source-shaped input, Ctrl assignment,
keyboard routes, and selected fighter portraits. Automatic production grouping
and original visual acceptance remain open. P58F1 through P58F3 restore the
system-selected planet, target effects, projectiles, and tractor/gravity fields.
The [P58F4 evidence](evidence/2026-09-15-tactical-selected-damage.md) then binds
source tactical ordinals to capital portraits `2001` through `2029`, composites
their lime mats over panel `1302`, and renders live faction-correct shield and
hull meters. [P58F5 evidence](evidence/2026-09-15-tactical-subsystem-field-commands.md)
restores all five subsystem-condition bitmap families through exact source
quantization and placement, plus exact field identities and capacities.
[P58F6 evidence](evidence/2026-09-15-tactical-live-subsystem-damage.md)
connects those conditions to the live damage path. The
[P58F7 evidence](evidence/2026-09-15-tactical-subsystem-repair-mobility.md)
restores the repair cadence and selection plus the engine-condition and active
tractor-drag mobility calculation.
[P58F8 evidence](evidence/2026-09-16-tactical-maneuver-movement.md)
restores the maneuver-state bonus, effective-power velocity, signed faction
movement, and millisecond position integration.
[P58F9 evidence](evidence/2026-09-17-tactical-command-assignment.md) restores
both original command panels, exact shared order and tactic codes,
source-shaped controls, disabled states, and commit/cancel delivery.
[P58F10 evidence](evidence/2026-09-17-tactical-order-execution.md) restores the
four maneuver waypoint constructors, Hold stop behavior, and the first Recover
carrier state. [P58F11 evidence](evidence/2026-09-18-tactical-command-progression.md)
restores source-rate signed turning, deterministic waypoint completion, and the
Docking and Recovered fighter states while preserving strategic squadron
counts. [P58F12 evidence](evidence/2026-09-18-tactical-attack-targeting.md)
restores typed Attack Fighters and Attack Capital Ships acquisition for both
capital and fighter owners. [P58F13 evidence](evidence/2026-09-19-tactical-attack-target-lifecycle.md)
restores live invalidation, stable same-class replacement, and exhausted-list
clearing. The [P58-B06 checkpoint](evidence/2026-09-22-tactical-completion-bundle.md)
adds capital and fighter combat, collision, automatic groups, retained
formations, the separate Death Star, original result/options panels, and both
trench-run routes. [P58-B13 evidence](evidence/2026-09-23-tactical-withdraw-confirmation.md)
restores the executable-derived withdrawal confirmation and exact panel,
text, control, cancel, and confirm contract. The
[P58-B14 evidence](evidence/2026-09-23-tactical-detail-escort.md) adds complete
destroyed presentation, compact GOKRES assignments in panel 1302, and direct
right-click Escort from `FUN_005ca6d0` with order code 1, retained target,
marker, follow, opportunity fire, and target cleanup. P58-B21 shares the
post-battle campaign route. P58-B22 adds one recovered tactical RNG stream,
persisted power allocation, completion/destruction callbacks, and the timed
trench producer. Whole-process RNG continuity, strategic commander binding,
native beam/playback comparison, rare audio callers, and original visual
acceptance remain open.

[P58-B15 evidence](evidence/2026-09-24-tactical-battle-alert-audio.md) traces
`FUN_0044f860` into the faction Battle Alert resources and recovers MDATA 307
plus event `0x14` to TACTICAL WAVE 13054 through `FUN_005bae60`,
`FUN_005ba980`, `FUN_005bad50`, and `FUN_005ba520`. The deterministic A1
crosswalk now maps all 106 cells; A0 coverage and strict acceptance remain
0/106.

[P58-B16 evidence](evidence/2026-09-24-tactical-weapon-audio.md) corrects the
provisional event label: `FUN_005a7500` registers event `0x14` as
`SHIP_TAKE_TORPEDO_HIT`, not ship destruction. Together with the audio-manager
tables and `FUN_005b3f10`, it maps events `0x0d–0x14` to all 22 WAVE
`13033–13054` variants and dispatches them from production capital and fighter
combat. Exact shared-RNG sequencing and remaining non-weapon/voice events stay
open.

[P58-B17 evidence](evidence/2026-09-24-tactical-command-voice.md) follows the
faction event bases in `FUN_005bae60` and the production command callers to 90
exact VOICEFXA/VOICEFXE recordings. Battle ready and task-force/RGBY maneuver,
attack, formation, and mission acknowledgements now dispatch through native
and browser audio backends. The focused muted browser gate loads and routes
all 22 weapon and 90 command-voice resources for both factions and viewports.
Result, withdrawal, and Death Star voice families, mixing, interruption,
audible native comparison, and strict A0 acceptance remain open.

[P58-B18 evidence](evidence/2026-09-25-tactical-complete-voice-bank.md) extends
that source table through event `0x13c` and proves complete transport of 285
recordings: VOICEFXA `14001–14122`, VOICEFXE `15001–15132`, and VOICEFXA
`15133–15163`. Production now dispatches selected withdrawal, battle-outcome,
Death Star, and RGBY trench-run transitions. The focused muted browser gate
loads and routes all 307 tactical weapon and voice resources for both factions
and viewports. Remaining completion, destruction, recovery, warning, and
ordered trench chatter callers, exact shared-RNG sequencing, mixing,
interruption, audible native comparison, and strict A0 acceptance remain open.

[P58-B19 evidence](evidence/2026-09-25-tactical-mixed-task-force-target.md)
follows `FUN_005a24d0`'s task-force ordinal check before hostile focus-target
assignment. Mixed capital selections now preserve manual, active, and Escort
targets and queue Alliance event `0x84` / WAVE `14101` or Imperial event
`0x102` / WAVE `15105`. Four muted faction/viewport cases pass; audible native
comparison and strict A0 acceptance remain open.

[P58-B22 evidence](evidence/2026-09-28-tactical-source-completion.md) follows
`FUN_0061a310`, `FUN_005a8a70`, `FUN_00501510`, `FUN_005015a0`,
`FUN_005a5cf0`, `FUN_005cfec0`, `FUN_005d04e0`, and `FUN_005d03f0`. The
bounded practical launcher now uses one ordered tactical RNG stream, persisted
shield/weapon allocation, exact completion/destruction callbacks, and the
timed trench-run producer. Strict A0 acceptance remains 0/106.

## Immediate implementation order

1. Trace SPT to BIN to frame and WAV selection for both factions on top of the
   verified type-302 advisor idle-frame decoder and transport.
2. Extend the decoder and transport to ALBRIEF and EMBRIEF.
3. Extend staging and the runtime pack with EData, dialogs,
   voices, and media without weakening deterministic manifests.
4. Complete the first recovered sector, system, and reference-rail checkpoint
   with exact item compositions, commands, thumbnails, and uncommon states,
   then continue through the remaining managed original object windows.
5. Continue the full GID mapping without replacement art: recover the code-built
   menu, expanded legend, remaining filter predicates and overlays, and exact
   map input.
6. Preserve the P58-B22 tactical implementation, bind the strategic commander
   slot, verify whole-process RNG continuity and remaining rare audio/native
   Death Star behavior, then acquire A0 evidence for the complete mapped
   matrix using the [ranked Windows/Ghidra recovery map](../../reference/space-battle-launcher/reverse-engineering-map.md).
7. Use original-runtime capture only for the remaining dynamic proof boundary.

No static discovery marks a surface complete. It closes only the corresponding
evidence fields; the original, native, and browser acceptance cells remain in
the main audit.
