# Ghidra RE Notes — Index

**5,977 function-note C files (5,773 `FUN_<address>.c` plus 204 named/support copies), Ghidra scripts, and indexed recovery notes**

Provenance: until 2026-09-26, 2,752 `FUN_<address>.c` files were empty placeholders from commit aa2b333. They were filled, and 188 functions cited elsewhere in the repo were added, with Ghidra 12.1.3 headless `CreateAndDecompileTargets.java` against the read-only project. 29 of those files explain instead of decompiling: 27 addresses lie inside another function and name it, 1 (`0x005587d0`) is a jump stub outside any function, and 1 records the only decompiler failure (`FUN_006197d2`, "Overlapping input varnodes"). No note is empty.
