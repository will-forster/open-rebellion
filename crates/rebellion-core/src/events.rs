//! Event system: conditional triggers and scripted actions.
//!
//! Events fire when all their conditions are satisfied. Most events are
//! one-shot (a character's story beat, a scripted reveal); some are recurring
//! (natural disasters, random bounty hunter spawns).
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! Follows the same stateless pattern as manufacturing and missions:
//! - `EventState` holds all defined events and the set of already-fired IDs.
//! - `EventSystem::advance(state, world, tick_events, rng_rolls)` evaluates
//!   every enabled event against the current game state and returns
//!   `Vec<FiredEvent>` — one entry per event that triggered this frame.
//! - The **caller** applies `FiredEvent::actions` to `GameWorld` / UI.
//! - `rebellion-core` stays headless: no IO, no random state, no mutation of
//!   `GameWorld` inside this module.
//!
//! # Random conditions
//!
//! `EventCondition::Random { probability }` consumes one value from the
//! caller-supplied `rng_rolls` slice (in event-definition order). If there
//! are fewer rolls than `Random` conditions the roll defaults to `1.0`
//! (never fires). Pass pre-generated rolls from a deterministic RNG (e.g.
//! `rand::Rng::gen::<f32>()`) so tests can control outcomes exactly.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use rebellion_core::events::{
//!     EventCondition, EventAction, EventState, EventSystem, GameEvent,
//! };
//! use rebellion_core::tick::TickEvent;
//! use rebellion_core::world::GameWorld;
//!
//! let mut state = EventState::new();
//! // Define events at game-start or load from JSON…
//! state.define(GameEvent {
//!     id: 1,
//!     name: "tick_threshold".into(),
//!     conditions: vec![EventCondition::TickAtLeast { tick: 10 }],
//!     actions: vec![EventAction::DisplayMessage {
//!         text: "Ten days have passed.".into(),
//!     }],
//!     is_repeatable: false,
//!     enabled: true,
//! });
//!
//! let world = GameWorld::default();
//! let tick_events = vec![TickEvent { tick: 10 }];
//! let fired = EventSystem::advance(&mut state, &world, &tick_events, &[]);
//! assert_eq!(fired.len(), 1);
//! ```
