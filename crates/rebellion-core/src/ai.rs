//! Rule-based AI manager for the computer-controlled faction.
//!
//! The AI evaluates the game state each `AI_TICK_INTERVAL` game-days and
//! produces a list of `AIAction` recommendations. The caller applies those
//! actions to `ManufacturingState`, `MissionState`, and `GameWorld`.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! Follows the same stateless pattern as manufacturing and mission systems:
//! - `AIState` holds per-faction persistent data (cooldowns, assignments)
//! - `AISystem::advance(state, world, mfg, missions, tick_events) -> Vec<AIAction>`
//! - Actions are recommendations only — the caller decides whether to apply them
//!
//! # Heuristics (ported from rebellion2's AIManager.cs)
//!
//! 1. **Officer assignment**: for each available (unassigned) character —
//!    - If major character AND unrecruited officers exist → recruitment mission
//!    - Else if major OR diplomacy > 60 → diplomacy mission targeting lowest-popularity system
//! 2. **Production — fighters**: if a system has idle manufacturing capacity,
//!    enqueue the best available fighter class for fleets with excess carrier slots
//! 3. **Production — facilities**: if a system has fewer than `MAX_CONSTRUCTION_YARDS`
//!    construction yards and has free slots, enqueue another
//!
//! # AI tick gating
//!
//! The AI only re-evaluates every `AI_TICK_INTERVAL` game-days. This prevents
//! thrashing and is consistent with the original game's turn-based cadence.
